## Contribution rules

Please use current custom uploader naming format for consistency. The file name and name should be just domain with lowercase:

```
example.com.sxcu
```

Because ShareX automatically uses request URL domain when the name field is empty, it is recommended to keep name field empty.

If one domain has more than one service or profile then append that info within brackets as below:

```
example.com (Image uploader).sxcu
example.com (URL shortener).sxcu
```

or

```
example.com (Anonymous).sxcu
example.com (User).sxcu
```
